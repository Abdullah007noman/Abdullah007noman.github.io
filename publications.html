      The paper addresses the limitations of traditional direct-to-cell (D2C) communication systems — namely capacity bottlenecks, high propagation losses, and unreliable coverage in remote or disaster-affected areas. 

To tackle this, the authors propose a UAV-enabled Space–Air–Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN) framework in which unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) act as adaptive relays between low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellites and user terminals. 

Their approach involves altitude-optimized UAV placement and environment-aware channel modelling (accounting for ionospheric, atmospheric, multipath and fading effects) to mitigate propagation losses and enhance link reliability. 


They evaluate the proposal using the NVIDIA Sionna simulator across varied environments and disaster-response scenarios, finding that the SAGIN framework yields about a 91.7% improvement in downlink throughput relative to a baseline D2C model, with an end-to-end latency around 12 ms.
